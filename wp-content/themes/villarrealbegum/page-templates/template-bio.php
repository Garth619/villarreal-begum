				<p>Alexander Begum is a founding shareholder of Villareal & Begum. Born and raised in Texas, Alex continues to practice law in the state where he grew up, with offices in San Antonio, Laredo, and McAllen. He earned his bachelor’s degree in Marketing and Finance from Trinity University in San Antonio and went on to study finance and legal writing at Harvard University before returning to Texas to attend Texas Tech University. While there, he earned a Masters of Business Administration with a concentration in Finance and a Doctorate of Jurisprudence.</p>

				<p>He later attended the Trial Lawyers College, an intense program that is open only to those lawyers who are dedicated to representing individuals, particularly the poor, injured, and otherwise needy. This program is not open to people who represent insurance companies, governments or large business. For Alex, who believes in the jury system and the importance of being not only a skilled attorney but caring for his clients on a human level, this program was too great an opportunity to miss. After being only one of 50 lawyers accepted into the program, he attended the nationally renowned Trial Lawyers College.</p>

				<p>Alex is passionate about helping others, which is why he has pursued a career in the law. He continues to find new ways to be of service, including regularly offering pro bono legal service to those in need. His willingness to serve others without concern for himself saved an entire Texas community faced with the potential loss of their homes. Outside of the legal sphere, Alex also serves as a board member for several charitable organizations.</p>
